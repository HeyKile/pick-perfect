Project Description:

When gardening, it can be tough to discern exactly when a fruit/vegetable is ready to be picked and eaten. Our project aims to make that easier. Our app’s main functionality is the ability to take an image of a fruit/vegetable and then tell the user whether it’s ripe enough or not. This will utilize cloud technologies and containerization to create an awesome application.

Project Structure:

The is a front-end interface for users to interact with, allowing them to upload photos of their plants to check growth stage. The backend processed the image from the front end, using an AI-powered image processing to determine the growth stage. The response is then sent back to the user, allowing them to take the next steps. Currently, we are looking to use Firebase, Cloud Run, and Vision AI to implement the project.
